  port: 5432,
});

How It Works
Frontend:

Users interact with a form to add new tasks and manage existing ones.
Tasks are displayed in a list, and each task can be edited or deleted.
Backend:

The Express server handles routes for adding, editing, and deleting tasks.
PostgreSQL is used to store and retrieve task data.
Database Interaction:

/submit: Adds a new task to the database.
/delete: Deletes a task by its ID.
/edit: Updates a taskâ€™s description.
/: Renders the main page with the current list of tasks.
